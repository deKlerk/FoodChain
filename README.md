# Food Chain plugin for Grasshopper

Food Chain offers a set of components to work with RDF data inside of Grasshopper. It uses Python.NET <https://pythonnet.github.io/> to access RDFLib, a Python module to create, load, search, edit data in RDF Graphs. <https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/>

It is still in an early stage of development and currently work in progress...

## Using Food Chain

In order to start using Food Chain, you will need to have **Python 3.7** installed on your machine and **RDFLib** (additional modules are listed in the "requirements.txt" file.
Food Chain components offer some of the most common tasks performed on RDF Graphs, facilitating the creation and manipulation of RDF data in a computational design environment.
